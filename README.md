# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction with Time Features and Cyclical Encoding

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting flight delays** using advanced time-based feature engineering and cyclical encoding techniques to capture periodic patterns in flight data.

- 🔍 **Comprehensive Time Analysis** – exploring delay patterns across hours, days, and time periods
- 🛠 **Cyclical Encoding** – implementing sine/cosine transformations for temporal features
- 📊 **Feature Engineering** – creating airline performance metrics, route analysis, and airport congestion features
- 🤖 **Multi-Model Comparison** – evaluating Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression
- 🎯 **Goal** – build accurate flight delay prediction models that understand temporal patterns and operational factors
